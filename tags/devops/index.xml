      <description>Docker-compose is used to run multiple containers as a single service. Letâ€™s suppose you had an application that required NGNIX and Django, you could create one yml file which would run both the containers as a service without the need to manage them separately.
In some cases, you may want to deploy your docker-compose on a remote host. For small projects setting up container orchestration tools like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, etc is time-consuming and hard if you are not familiar with them.</description>
